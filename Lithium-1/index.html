                    Kelp is known for being able to absorb and store heavy metals and
                    other pollutants from the environment. This property could
                    possibly be used in developing new bioremediation technologies for
                    cleaning up contaminated water and soil. Heavy metals such as lead
                    and mercury, as well as radioactive isotopes such as iodine-131
                    and cesium-137, can be absorbed by kelp from the surrounding
                    water. Heavy metals could otherwise lower energy levels and damage
                    organs (Jaishankar et al., 2014) and radioactive isotopes could
                    increase the risk of cancers or cause radiation sickness (CDC,
                    2018).

                    Bioremediation is the process of removing toxins from the
                    environment using living organisms. Through phytoremediation,
                    marine macroalgae like kelp and seaweed were shown to be
                    successful in removing different pollutants from aquatic
                    environments. Heavy metals, chemical compounds, and other toxins
                    in water are absorbed and accumulated by these algae, eliminating
                    them from the environment. The algae may then be utilized for
                    various applications, including biofuels, fertilizers, and animal
                    feed. Furthermore, the production of these algae can potentially
                    give economic advantages to coastal communities. The
                    bioremediation potential of marine macroalgae is an important
                    field of study, with continuous attempts to refine the process and
                    discover novel uses.

                    Through research, kelp was found to be useful in the remediation
                    of polluted water in regions such as industrial zones and mining
                    sites. According to research published in the journal Marine
                    Pollution Bulletin, a dangerous amount of toxic metals such as
                    mercury and lead can be seen absorbed in seaweed in Europe and
                    Asia, showing the feasibility of using seaweed for bioremediation
                    (Paz et al., 2019). This research on the bioremediation potential
                    of marine macroalgae takes a multidisciplinary approach, combining
                    chemical and biology concepts. To completely comprehend how
                    macroalgae absorb and eliminate pollutants from the environment,
                    it is vital to examine their chemical mechanisms and how they
                    interact with various contaminants.

                  Bioaccumulation and biodegradation are two important biological
                  processes in macroalgae that help assist in bioremediation.
                  Bioaccumulation refers to the accumulation of substances, such as
                  pollutants or nutrients, in living organisms over time. Macroalgae
                  bioaccumulate essential nutrients such as nitrogen or phosphorus for
                  plant growth, but they can also accumulate harmful pollutants such
                  as microplastics and heavy metals (Paz et al., 2019). Biodegradation
                  refers to the process in which organic substances are broken down by
                  living organisms such as bacteria or protozoa, as they use the
                  organic compounds as a source of energy by breaking them down into
                  simpler compounds such as carbon dioxide and water. In the context
                  of bioremediation, biodegradation of macroalgae can be used to break
                  down pollutants into less harmful compounds. Some species of
                  macroalgae have been shown to be effective at degrading organic
                  compounds such as polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons and petroleum
                  hydrocarbons (Bisht et al., 2015). One specific type of macroalgae,
                  kelp, gets rid of greenhouse gases like CO2 by absorbing it into its
                  tissues and using it in photosynthesis, which is the process of
                  using energy from sunlight and nutrients to make food, lessening the
                  CO2 concentration in the environment (Churchill &amp; Daniel, 2021).
                  This is beneficial for the environment since excessive greenhouse
                  gases raise the Earth&apos;s temperatures. With these biological
                  processes, macroalgae helps reduce the concentration of pollutants
                  in the surrounding ecosystem, and assists in creating a sustainable
                  environment.

                  Diffusion and mass transfer are two processes in macroalgae that
                  fall under physics. Mass transfer is the movement of a substance
                  from one location to another (Lewis, 1996). Two aforementioned
                  processes, ion exchange and adsorption, involve the transfer of
                  pollutants from the environment to the macroalgae surface, therefore
                  involving mass transfer. The rate of this mass transfer depends on
                  multiple factors such as the concentration of the pollutant, the
                  surface area of the macroalgae, or the flow rate of the water.
                  Diffusion is a specific type of mass transfer. It is the movement of
                  molecules from a high concentration to low concentration. This can
                  assist in bioremediation as when contaminants such as pesticides or
                  heavy metals come into contact with the macroalgae, those particles
                  can be diffused into the algal cells and interact with molecules of
                  two aforementioned processes, chelation and adsorption, and be
                  converted into detoxified and remediated substances which are then
                  diffused back into the environment. With the help of these physical
                  processes, macroalgae can be used as tools for bioremediation.

                Chelation, adsorption, and ion exchange are important processes in
                macroalgae that help in bioremediation. Chelation is the process of a
                metal ion binding to a molecule, forming a complex. In algae, there
                are molecules called siderophores which are able to chelate iron ions
                and transport them into the algae&apos;s cells (Årstøl &amp;
                Hohmann-Marriott, 2019). Marine brown algae contain a sugar alcohol
                called mannitol. Mannitol (C6H14O6) has a hydroxyl (-OH) group
                structure that can bind to metal ions due to lone electron pairs
                forming coordination bonds with metal ions, forming a stable complex
                that the algae can easily excrete (Doleźal et al., 1973). This can
                help detoxify heavy metals like cadmium and mercury in macroalgae, as
                the metal-mannitol complexes are less toxic and can be more easily
                eliminated by the algae. Ion exchange in algae occurs when the
                negatively charged polysaccharides in the algae&apos;s cell walls bind
                with positively charged ions such as calcium and magnesium, allowing
                the algae to accumulate nutrients. The two aforementioned mechanisms
                fall under the process of adsorption. It is the process of molecules
                adhering to the surface of a solid or liquid. Macroalgae are known to
                be able to adsorb pollutants such as heavy metals like cadmium or
                mercury, and organic compounds too such as pesticides or herbicides
                (Ordóñez et al., 2023). Because of the large surface area of
                macroalgae, they are a very useful tool that can be used to control
                large amounts of pollutants. These chemical mechanisms facilitated by
                biological processes can be utilized for bioremediation, as they are
                useful in removing and absorbing pollutants and heavy metals from
                contaminated water and soil.

                    The research on bioremediation with macroalgae, particularly kelp
                    and seaweed, can help to create effective and long-lasting
                    strategies for cleaning up polluted aquatic habitats, providing a
                    habitat for marine life and improving the state of the Earth.
                    These techniques may be used in a range of situations, including
                    industrial, agricultural, and residential settings. Workers in

                    macroalgae in bioremediation and other applications is likely to
