                <h1 id="intro">Introduction</h1>
                <p>With the world constantly evolving, there is a constant need for new and better technologies. With these innovations, there also must be a constant supply of energy to power them. Fossil fuels are doing the job well, but these nonrenewable energy supplies will run out sooner or later.<br><br></p>
                <p>Solar panels are a good renewable alternative as an energy source, as these are "enough to handle the entire world's energy consumption for a full year" (n.d.). Instead of relying on non-renewable resources to power inventions, these panels are already well-known and proven to be effective.<br><br></p>
                <p>The design of The California Institute of Technology (CIT) and Karlsruhe Institute of Technology (KIT)'s solar panels are based on the pattern and design of the black rose butterfly or Pachliopta aristolochiae which utilizes a semiconductor material of thin film with sheets of hydrogenated amorphous silicon, topped with a layer of minuscule holes with varying sizes.<br</p>
                <p>Yirka (2017) mentions that normal thin-film solar cells are known to be less expensive, lighter, and flexible, although they perform less efficiently than traditional crystal-based cells. In order to relieve this, the application of the butterfly-wing-inspired nanostructures aims to improve the thin-film cells&#39 efficiency.<br><br></p>

                                    The Black Rose Butterfly (Pachliopta aristolochiae) is a species of butterfly that is active during the day and frequently visits many flowers, such as lantana, Dwarf Poinciana, yellow cosmos, and porterweed (Common Rose Butterfly Encyclopedia of Life, n.d.).<br><br>
                                    KIT's Institute of Microstructure Technology (IMT) was inspired by the biology of this butterfly and has utilized biomimicry based on the animals' wing color and wing pattern. The Common rose butterfly possesses a very dark color on its wings, allowing for efficient light absorption for heat management for the body (Oberdorf, n.d.-b).<br><br>
                                    The team's researchers, led by Hendrik Hölscher and Radwanul H. Siddique, replicated the butterfly's nanostructures in the silicon-absorbing layer of a thin-film solar cell. Cross-connections between the ridges on the butterfly's wings form disordered "nanoholes" that enhance light absorption (Oberdorf, n.d.-b).<br>

                                    The solar cell has a semiconductor material made of thin-film hydrogenated amorphous silicon (a-Si:H), a low-cost alternative and takes the shortest amount of time to produce energy. However, it suffers from light-induced degradation — its performance decreases when exposed to the sun for the first few hours (SinoVoltaics, n.d.). To compensate for this flaw, implementing metallic nanostructures in the active absorbing layers of a-Si:H solar cells has proven to improve optical absorption. In recent research in plasmonics, the nanostructures are proven to capture sunlight in a wide range of angles, absorb a broad range of wavelengths of light, and provide an independence from polarization state of incident light, which overall improves the light trapping scheme and enhance light absorption by 18.51% (Vora, 2015).<br><br>
                                    Electric field formation or the photovoltaic effect happens in the hydrogenated amorphous silicon (a-Si:H) layer. These Photovoltaic cells (also called PV cells) capture the light from the sun that directly hits it, and it converts this light into electricity.<br><br>
                                    Solar radiation, also known as electromagnetic radiation, is composed of photons. As the solar panel absorbs it, the semiconductor material absorbs a part of the photons, producing electron-hole pairs. If an electrical circuit is formed, the voltage difference drives the electrons from the negative to the positive side of the junction and creates an electric current in the form of electricity (Asdrubali et al., 2019).<br>

                                <p>
                                    In normal solar panels, unpatterned PV cells, the cells without nanostructures, are arranged in an orderly manner on a flat surface. The angle at which the sun&#39s rays hit the PV cells is called the “angle of incidence” (AOI), and the AOI of a solar panel affects its efficiency and power output. The AOI’s effect on the efficiency can be calculated as a ratio from the maximum output as cos(AOI), for example, if the AOI is 10 degrees, then the efficiency of the solar panel at that angle would be cos(AOI)/cos(0).  To get the maximum output, the sun’s light has to hit the panels at a perpendicular angle, or at an AOI of 0 degrees, to capture as many photons as possible. This phenomenon happens close to midday, when the sun faces the solar panels directly. However, the rest of the hours in the morning have a larger AOI and therefore lesser efficiency (Honsberg, C., Bowden, S., 2019).<br><br>
                                    However, this nanostructure-patterned solar cell design is not a completely flat surface, as it utilizes holes. This creates a larger surface area in which light rays can hit at an angle. These holes act like funnels, as when light strikes against the walls of the holes, reflected light is bounced into the panel and is caught by the second layer of PV cells. Compare this with how light rays are reflected away in the flat solar panel, which causes the panel to lose efficiency without using anti-reflection coating material.<br><br>
                                    The modified solar panel surface essentially concentrates suns rays with AOIs farther from 0 degrees and increases solar panel efficiency when the sun is not perpendicular to the panel.<br><br>
                                    At an AOI of 0 degrees, unpatterned solar panels have been shown to have generally lesser absorption efficiency, than patterned (with holes) solar panels, and with a significant decrease in absorption of lights with wavelengths longer than 520nm.<br><br>
                                    Compared to the unpatterned solar panels being the most efficient at 0 degrees AOI, the patterned solar panels are the least efficient at an AOI of 0. Despite that, at an AOI of 0 degrees, the patterned solar panel has a relative efficiency of 97% more than the unpatterned solar panel, and its efficiency rises until its peak efficiency at an AOI of 10 to 30 degrees. At 50 degrees AOI, the patterned solar panel is 207% more efficient than the unpatterned, this being its peak relative absorption increase (Siddique et al, 2017).<br>

                <p>In conclusion, the development of solar panels modeled after the wings of the Pachliopta aristolochiae offers a promising response to the rising need for renewable energy sources while minimizing the negative environmental effects. The replication of the butterfly's nanostructures and the use of thin film hydrogenated amorphous silicon enable improved efficiency at low cost. The solar panels' patterned surface also enables more light absorption at various AOIs, producing a higher output than conventional solar panels.<br><br></p>
                <p>Improved solar panel longevity and methods to lessen light-induced degradation in thin film hydrogenated amorphous silicon could be the subject of future study. Additionally, looking into additional patterns and designs drawn from nature may result in solar panels that are even more effective and eco-friendly.<br><br></p>
                <p>It is suggested that greater emphasis should be put on the creation of revolutionary technologies and renewable energy sources. To decrease our dependence on non-renewable resources and lessen the effects of climate change, governments, businesses, and individuals should give renewable energy solutions top priority when investing in and implementing them.<br></p>
