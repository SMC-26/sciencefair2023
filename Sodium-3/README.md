# Music Therapy as a Supplementary Form of Mental Health Treatment

Have you ever had an experience when you were having a really bad day and when you listened to **music**, it improved your mood? Have you ever wondered if there was an actual scientific explanation for why this happens? Can this help our moods or feelings? This project aims to answer these questions and find out if this can be a revolutionary discovery for future methods of therapy.

Music therapists use a person's responses and connections to music to encourage **positive** changes in mood and general mental mindset. Music therapy can include listening to music or creating music with instruments of all types. It may also involve singing or moving to music. It is an alternative to other types of therapy, such as counseling or cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) (Zoppi, 2020).
