					Currently, hundreds of thousands of people are waiting for an organ transplant., but unfortunately, the world does not have enough donors to accommodate all the patients. And this is where the bioprinting of human tissue comes in. 3D bioprinting is an emerging branch of regenerative medicine, it is similar to 3D printing. However, bioprinting uses bio-ink, a printable material that contains living cells.

					Materials or cells may be obtained from donors or, much better, from patients to lessen the chances of the body rejecting the printed tissue. Although printing thin tissues, like skin and meniscus, is the only successful project in the present, researchers are looking forward to the future of this technology.

					<p id="text-bio" style="display: none;">Tissue printing is a 3D printing technology that involves creating three-dimensional structures of living cells and biomaterials to produce tissue-like constructs. The process usually involves depositing cells and supporting biomaterials layer by layer using specialized printers, and the cells are carefully placed in a specific pattern to create a desired structure. In order to actually print tissue, we need biomaterials. Biomaterials are materials that were designed to interact with different biological systems, such as cells, tissues, and organs, either in vivo (work performed in a living organism) or in vitro (work performed outside of the living organism). Biomaterials can either be synthetic or natural in origin, and are used in a variety of real-world applications in the fields of medicine and biotechnology. They’re typically characterized by their ability to support cell adhesion and proliferation, and to facilitate tissue growth and regeneration. They may also be designed to mimic the structural and mechanical properties of natural tissues and organs, or to deliver therapeutic agents like drugs or growth factors. Some examples of common biomaterials include; Polymer Synthetic, which are commonly used as biomaterials die to their biocompatibility and tunable mechanical properties; Ceramics, which are used as bone graft substitutes due to their ability to promote bone growth and regeneration; Natural materials are another commonly used biomaterial due to their biocompatibility and ability to mimic the structural and mechanical properties of natural tissues.</p>

					<p id="text-chem" style="display: none;">The use of bio-ink, which is made up of either natural or synthetic biomaterials. Biomaterials are a key component of printing tissue. Polymers are a readily available and easy to mold material used to make tissue. Metals and metal alloys such as gold, platinum, titanium, and more are used to make orthopedic implants. Ceramics and carbon compounds are used to make bioactive orthopedic implants, while calcium phosphate salts (HA), glass, and oxides of aluminum and titanium are used to make dental implants and artificial hearing aids. These are examples of biomaterials and what they are used for in 3D Printing as there are many more biomaterials for different purposes.</p>

					<p id="text-phys" style="display:none;">3D bioprinting is mainly used for its mechanical properties. An example is the duration of the creation of the tissue. Some researchers have been experimenting with different mechanical devices that can improve the speed of bioprinting. The model predicted that the bio-inks would merge more quickly in the presence of an external force, and the researchers used this prediction to create their approach. They were able to expedite bio-ink fusion using the model while minimizing damage to preexisting cells by adjusting the force's magnitude. The grooves' geometry produced a rotational torque and other mechanical forces that caused the bioink segments to press against each other, and by imaging the structural evolution of the fusing bioinks, they found that fusion occurred 3 times faster in the grooves than it did on a flat platform. The forces acting on the bioinks can be precisely adjusted in the bioprinter that the researchers are currently creating (Chen, 2021).</p>

				<h1 class="section-title">Application and Conclusion</h1>
				<p>
					3D Bioprinting can be applied in medical related fields due to how convenient the tissue and organ prints can be. For instance, the tissue prints can be used to replace damaged tissue and organs, and potentially replace organ donors as the source of organs for many unfortunate patients. Since the donor’s organs have to have cells that are compatible with the patient, it would be a hassle to find one that is compatible, however with bioprinting, the cells can be taken from the patient himself and be used for the production of the tissue. The tissues made from bioprinting might also be used to replace human volunteers in drug testing labs as the printed tissue may mimic that of the average human being. Bioprinting however, isn’t limited to the medical field alone, as the printed tissue could be potentially used as an alternative to animals in testing labs, saving over hundreds of millions of animals.

					In conclusion, 3D Bioprinting is an extension of regular 3D printing, making use of the latter’s technique of three-dimensional printing and incorporating biological materials, also known as bioinks, into the process. The bioinks can either be synthetic and natural in origin, and is usually used to mimic the biological structure of tissues and organs. The technology of bioprinting can be used in the medical field, with an example of this being the source of organs for patients to replace their damaged/missing organs, and for doctors to experiment and perform surgery on. Although the technology still isn’t perfect, it has already been proven to be fully functional and its still currently being refined continuously as more and more breakthroughs and improvements on how to improve its technology are found.
